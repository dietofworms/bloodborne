# Bloodborne Boss Completions

Analyse Bloodborne PS4 trophy data to uncover boss‑completion patterns.

---

## Overview

This project processes PS4 Bloodborne trophy data using a Jupyter Notebook (`BloodbornePlayerStats.ipynb`) to explore trends in boss completion across players. Visual insights are captured in `plot.png`, with raw data in `dataset.csv`.

---

## Contents

* **`BloodbornePlayerStats.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook with data loading, analysis, and visualization.
* **`dataset.csv`** – Tabular trophy data for boss completions.
* **`plot.png`** – Generated plot illustrating key findings.
* **`.gitignore`** – Standard exclusions.

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install required libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib).
3. Launch the notebook and run all cells to generate analyses and visuals.

---

## Objectives

* Explore completion rates across bosses
* Compare player performance trends
* Identify anomalies or interesting patterns

---

## Why It Matters

Understanding boss completion stats sheds light on player behaviour, difficulty spikes, and game progression trends. Useful for researchers, game designers, and fans interested in data-driven insights.
